MagiDuck
	
	This winter was going to be quite a handful.
	
	Magi was the only duck in her family, who couldn't fly.
	She did however have the ability to shoot fireballs from
	her wings, which was comforting at least!
	
	Every autumn, when all the other ducks flew south for
	their annual vacation, she stayed behind to look after 
	the family castle.
	
	This year was supposed to be the same as every other, 
	but something strange happened. A dragon!
	
	The dragon was looking for a new place to party, since
	the last one had burnt down. The duck family castle seemed 
	abandoned and suitable for a decent kegger! He took care
	to invite all his friends as well.
