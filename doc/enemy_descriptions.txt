Creatures:

	Eggy
	
		Little critters that love to live under 
		old egg shells and hop around causing trouble.
	
	Babat
	
		Long time residents in every castle. 
		They panic easilly so watch your head!

	Drooloplasm

		Sometimes ectoplasm from the crypts condenses 
		into these strange creatures. They spend their 
		time reminiscing all the meals they ate when 
		they were alive, which causes them to drool 
		uncontrollably.
	
	Croc
		
		Crocs get lost from their moats sometimes and
		when they're not in their natural habitat they
		get a little stressed and might bite people!
	
	Sir Croc
	
		These guys are just like Crocs, but take their
		jobs way more seriously. They have a shield that
		protects their front and a spear to stab with.

	Ancestral Skull
		
		Your ancestors were totally awesome dinosaurs!
		The only downside is, they really like to haunt
		their descendants. Their immortal skulls float
		around the castle halls, apparently having a 
		great deal of fun making life difficult for the
		living.
